# Hyper Text Protocol

allows client (computer with an agent eg. Google chrome browser on the user side) to request text with links and all be sent over the internet to the server (computer in the cloud where websites and other assets ar stored) to find and allow us to see that text document and use the links in it to go somewhere else, etc.

HYPER Text is not normal text (it means "beyond text"), it is a text in HTML using various elements/tags which enable users to view (request from servers) content and go from one place to the other inside that document or outside it using LINKS.

# Links

```<a>``` - this element represents a connection between two resources.
